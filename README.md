Some handy tools for making Matlab a little more usable

**Future Work:**
- Object Oriented Figures. Why? Because Figure code sucks. There should just be Figure object
- Write one image matrix onto another. Why? Combing many images into a composite without nasty Figures.
- Unix-like less. Why? Matlab in a terminal is part of my daily routine, and outputs can be large. Try env.
- File list filtering. Why? Often I find myself loading many files.
